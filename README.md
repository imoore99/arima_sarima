## Time-Series Forecasting - Four Part Series

#### Assessing the Nature and Behavior of Time-Series Data by Model Comparison

##### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

- Purpose: Provide comprehensive guide to time series forecasting using ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters methods, demonstrating practical applications across stationary and non-stationary financial data.
- Objective: Compare forecasting model performance across different data characteristics, assess stationarity requirements, and develop practical framework for model selection with confidence interval validation.

##### DATA SOURCES:

- Stationary Data: Financial series with consistent statistical properties over time
- Non-Stationary Data: Trending financial time series requiring differencing or transformation
- Seasonal Patterns: Data exhibiting regular cyclical behavior
- Validation: Out-of-sample testing with confidence interval assessment

##### TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Core Stack:

- Python - Primary analysis environment
- statsmodels - ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters and statistical testing
- sklearn - Linear Regression and R2 Scores
- pandas/numpy - Data manipulation and numerical computing
- matplotlib/seaborn - Time series visualization and forecast plotting

Development Tools:

- Jupyter - Interactive analysis environment
- Git - Version control and collaboration
